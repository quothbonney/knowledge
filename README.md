# Knowledge

Attached are various brief, terse explainers from my self-study, MIT courses, and learned understanding. The structure of these notes is inspired by the recitation notes for the MIT 18.C06 course. 

### Principles
- Unless absolutely necessary, all explainers should be less than three pages.
- Bottom line always up front. Essential equations, facts, or knowledge should be easily identifiable and presented in the beginning of the explainer.
- Proofs, examples, and algorithms should be in the appendix of each explainer unless said example, proof, or other blocked content is critical to understand the topic.
- Explainers should be well-formatted in Markdown, Typst, or $\LaTeX$.
